# Wireless-Signal-Modulation-with-Mechanical-Vibrations
This repository provides code for modulating radio signals based on mechanical vibrations, demodulating received signals to extract information, and processing demodulated signals to produce sound output.


# Radio Signal Modulation and Demodulation

This repository contains code for modulating and demodulating radio signals based on mechanical vibrations. It provides a starting point for exploring alternative methods of wireless communication and signal processing.

## Code Overview

The code consists of the following main functions:

- `modulateSignal`: Modulates the radio signal based on mechanical vibrations.
- `demodulateSignal`: Demodulates the received signal to extract the modulated information.
- `processSignal`: Processes the demodulated signal and produces the sound output.

The main function `main` sets up the hardware components, generates and transmits the radio signal, receives the modulated signal, demodulates it, processes the demodulated signal, and outputs the sound.

## Usage

To use the code:

1. Include the necessary libraries and headers.
2. Set up the hardware components and configure the circuit.
3. Customize the modulation and demodulation algorithms in the `modulateSignal` and `demodulateSignal` functions, respectively.
4. Implement the signal processing algorithm in the `processSignal` function to produce sound output.
5. Build and run the code.
