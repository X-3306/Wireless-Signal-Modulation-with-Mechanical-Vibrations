# Wireless-Signal-Modulation-with-Mechanical-Vibrations
This repository provides code for modulating radio signals based on mechanical vibrations, demodulating received signals to extract information, and processing demodulated signals to produce sound output.


# Radio Signal Modulation and Demodulation

This repository contains code for modulating and demodulating radio signals based on mechanical vibrations. It provides a starting point for exploring alternative methods of wireless communication and signal processing.

# usage description for each of the code files:

modulation.c - This file contains the main implementation of signal modulation and processing functions. It implements functionality like signal modulation, encryption, demodulation, and audio output generation. To use this file, it should be compiled and linked into an executable program.
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

modulation.h - This is a header file containing declarations for the functions implemented in modulation.c. Any code that wants to call those functions should #include this header to access the prototypes. It allows modularization by separating declarations from definitions.
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

testencryption.c - This file contains a test case and validation code for the encryptSignal() function. It tests that encryptSignal() produces the expected encrypted output. To use this, compile and run testencryption.c along with encryption.c to verify correct encryption behavior.
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

encryption.c - This file provides the implementation of the encryptSignal() function to encrypt a signal. testencryption.c depends on and uses this encryption function. To use this file, it should be compiled with any code that needs to call encryptSignal(), like the test case.
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

# In summary:

modulation.c/modulation.h provide the core signal processing functions
encryption.c contains the reusable encryption function
testencryption.c is a test harness to validate encryption.c
