### DESCRYPTION ###
fundamental signal processing and encryption functions for encoding information on communication signals. The main techniques demonstrated are modulation, encryption, demodulation, and audio output generation.

In practice, these techniques could be applied to build radio communication systems to transmit audio information securely. For example, it could be used in ham/amateur radio by hobbyists to create their own encrypted channel for voice communication. The modulation schemes can encode voice into a radio-frequency signal, while encryption prevents eavesdropping.

More broadly, it showcases common digital signal processing concepts used in many telecommunication systems like radio, cellular networks, and Bluetooth. The principles of modulating data onto carrier waves, encrypting for security, and reconstructing audio/data after transmission are widely applied. These core algorithms power a range of wireless protocols and standards.


# simple compile encryption files:
(Kali-Linux) --> `gcc test-encryptSignal.c encryptSignal.c -o resultfile`

# usage description for each of the code files:

modulation.c - This file contains the main implementation of signal modulation and processing functions. It implements functionality like signal modulation, encryption, demodulation, and audio output generation. To use this file, it should be compiled and linked into an executable program.
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

modulation.h - This is a header file containing declarations for the functions implemented in modulation.c. Any code that wants to call those functions should #include this header to access the prototypes. It allows modularization by separating declarations from definitions.
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

testencryption.c - This file contains a test case and validation code for the encryptSignal() function. It tests that encryptSignal() produces the expected encrypted output. To use this, compile and run testencryption.c along with encryption.c to verify correct encryption behavior.
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

encryption.c - This file provides the implementation of the encryptSignal() function to encrypt a signal. testencryption.c depends on and uses this encryption function. To use this file, it should be compiled with any code that needs to call encryptSignal(), like the test case.
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

# In summary:

modulation.c/modulation.h provide the core signal processing functions
encryption.c contains the reusable encryption function
testencryption.c is a test harness to validate encryption.c
